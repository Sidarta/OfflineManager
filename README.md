# OfflineManager - Handle Offline Retrofit calls

This lib offers an easy way for developers to provide offline functionality and treatment in their app.
It handles Retrofit calls and offers methods to cater for when device had no connection, or for when server seems to be offline or not responding.

## Prerequisites

### API Support
This Lib is only supported on SDK >= 21. This is because services used to execute calls on the background are not supported and optmized for previous SDK versions.

### Retrofit2 is a prerequisite
```
compile 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.1.0'
```


## Configuring on the App

Configuring and using the API is very very simple.

### 1. Add permissions on Manifest

```xml
 <!--Permissions required and used by Offline Manager-->
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
 <!---->
```

### 2. Declare and initialize OfflineManager
```java
//OfflineManager
OfflineManager mManager;

...

 //initializing offlineManager with its Builder
 mManager = new OfflineManager.Builder(this, mGetQuoteBtn)
            .maxTimeoutSeconds(3)
            .build();
```
Like shown, You can configure custom timeout values in the builder, but itÂ´s not required.

### 3. Use

To use you need to declare a retrofit call

```java
 //separating creation of a retrofit call
Call retrofitCall = mRetrofitApi.getOrPutSomething(headerParam1, headerParam2/);
```

... Then instead of using *Enqueue*, use API method passing the call and configuration parameters

```java
mManager.treatedCall(
    retrofitCall, 
    OfflineManager.DeviceOfflineTreatment.Flexible, //Flexible mode - user interaction via pop up
    OfflineManager.ServerOfflineTreatment.Flexible, //Flexible mode - user interaction via pop up
    5,          //number of retries in case of server offline
    true,       //verbose - true: all interactions will give a feedback message to the user
    new OfflineManager.CustomCallbackSuccess() {        //implement response callback here
        @Override
        public void responseCallback(Call call, Response response) {
            //handles on response
        }
    },
    new OfflineManager.CustomCallbackFail() {           //implement failure callback here
        @Override
        public void failCallback(Call call, Throwable t) {
            //handles on failure
        }
    }
);
```

## Using custon strings

The lib already implements default messages for all cases. Programer can override them to provide his own custom messages (and also implements internationalization)

Strings are:

```xml
<!--default pop up controls-->
<string name="pop_up_yes">Yes</string>
<string name="pop_up_no">No</string>

<!--enforce device mode-->
<string name="enforce_no_connection_feedback">Your device does not have connection. Please try again later.</string>

<!--flexible mode dialog texts (title and message) -->
<string name="flexible_dialog_connection_title">No connection</string>
<string name="flexible_dialog_connection_message">Your device does not have connection. Do you wish to automatically proceeds when internet becomes available?</string>
<string name="flexible_dialog_server_retry_title">Server appears to be offline...</string>
<string name="flexible_dialog_server_retry_message">Do you wish for it to be done again in a few minutes?</string>

<!--verbose mode yes feedback strings-->
<string name="flexible_yes_selected_device_offline">Your action was stored and will take effect as soon as the device gets an active connection.</string>
<string name="flexible_no_selected_device_offline">"Action not taken. You can try again later."</string>
<string name="last_retry_finished">last retry finished</string>
<string name="no_action">Your server is offline. Please try again in a later time.</string>
<string name="flexible_yes_selected_server_offline">Action stored, will be tried again in a bit</string>
<string name="flexible_no_selected_server_offline">Ok, maybe try again later for yourself</string>
<string name="service_onresponse">Action was able to complete now.</string>
```
